Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic appliction of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software engineering enable creation of of software applications that power various aspects of modern life in communication,entertainment, healthcare and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming language such as Fortran C
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
The rise of agile methodologies in 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Involves gathering and documenting the needs of a user and system requirements
Designing-Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation- Writing codes and building software accirding to the design specifications
Testing-Testing the software to ensure its functional and meets quality standards
Deployment of the software to the users
Maintainance- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach to software development where each project phase must be fully completed  before moving to the next phase,with each phase cascading into the next. It's maily preferred on projects with predictable timelines and budgets,where changes expected are crucial and the project has low risks.

Agile emphasizes on itinerative development cycles,continous collaboration with the customer and repid adaptation to changing client requirements. It's used on high risks projects,where customer feedback is crucial

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
A   quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing tests
A project Manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is a sotware application that provides facilities for software development.Example Intelli J IDEA. They  are designed to maximize a programmer's productivity by providing components similar to a user interface.
VCS are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines to deliver software products can lead to low quality products
Change of requirements by clients may lead to project delays
Technical debts from accrued shortcuts which can affect future development efforts.
Software engineers can overcome these challenges by communicating effectively,prioritizing urgent tasks and assessing project goals and timelines regularly


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual modules of software
Integration Testing is testing interactions between various subsystems
Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirement to ensure it meets user needs.

Testing of software is important as it helps identify and fixdefectsearly in the development process leading to high quality software

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering id the process of craftingsn instructio in order to produce its best possible output from a genertive artificial intelligence model.
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain the best results in the first prompt,thus improving accuracy and efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague prompt- What is the role of a software engineer
 Specific -What is the role of a software engineer in developing and maintaining systems.
